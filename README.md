# Insiten Coding Challenge

## Business Problem

A company is looking to achieve inorganic growth through acquisitions. They have asked us to develop an online tool to track and analyze potential target companies.

## Challenge

Develop a prototype that will allow the client to perform the following activities:

- [X] View a list of targets
- [X] Edit an existing target
- [X] Create a new target
- [X] Delete a target

Assumptions:

- Use a modern JavaScript framework
  - [X] React
- Data does not need to be persisted
  - [X] Use mock data
- Examples of data to be captured:

  - [X] Status (e.g., researching, pending approval, approved, declined)
  - [X] CompanyInfo
  - [X] KeyContacts
  - [X] FinancialPerformance

## Run, Test, Build

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
